# Employee Performance Analysis at INX Future Inc.

## Project Overview
This project aims to identify non-performing employees at INX Future Inc., a leading data analytics and automation solutions provider. By utilizing data analytics and machine learning, we analyze employee data to uncover issues affecting performance and provide actionable insights to improve service delivery and client satisfaction while maintaining employee morale.


## Data Collection
Data was collected from various sources within the organization, including HR, IT, and performance metrics. The data includes demographics, employment information, performance metrics, attendance, and engagement levels.

## Data Preprocessing
Data cleaning involved handling missing values, normalizing/standardizing data, encoding categorical variables, and identifying outliers to prepare the dataset for analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was conducted to understand data distributions, identify correlations, and visualize trends and patterns, helping us gain initial insights into the data.

## Feature Engineering
New features were created from existing data to better capture employee performance and engagement. Examples include average performance ratings over time and engagement scores based on participation in company activities.

## Model Building
Several classification algorithms were trained, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. The models were evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-Score, and ROC-AUC.

## Model Evaluation
Cross-validation was performed to ensure model stability and robustness. The best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics.

## Insights and Recommendations
Feature importance analysis helped identify key factors affecting employee performance. Actionable insights were provided to management to address performance issues effectively.

## Deployment
A system was developed for continuous monitoring of employee performance using the trained model. Dashboards and reports were implemented for management to make informed decisions.

## Results
The project successfully identified non-performing employees and provided insights into the root causes of performance issues. This enabled management to take targeted actions without significantly affecting employee morale.

## Conclusion
This project helps INX Future Inc. improve service delivery and client satisfaction while maintaining its reputation as a top employer. The repository includes datasets, code, and documentation for replicating and understanding the analysis process.
